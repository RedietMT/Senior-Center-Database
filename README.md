Senior Center Database Project - SQL 
The Senior Center Care Database (SCCD) is a health care tool we developed to 
facilitate the communication and information exchange of geriatric health care 
providers and senior living facility staff. The overarching goal of this project and tool 
is to help our stakeholders - the health care providers and the living facility staff, 
have a go-to tool, that provides information such as the drugs a patient is 
prescribed, the frequency of administration, the ailments they may have, potential 
co-morbidities to watch out for, how often the patient needs to visit certain types of 
doctors, contact information for the family of the patient and who are due for a 
routine check based on their last checkup date... Moreover, the database is 
anonymized via alphanumeric patient IDs.
